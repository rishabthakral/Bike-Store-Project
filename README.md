# Bike-Store-Project
In this project, I utilized a combination of SQL, Excel, and Tableau to streamline the analysis of bike store data. First, I employed SQL to clean and preprocess the raw data. Next, I utilized Excel for data modeling, establishing relationships between different tables and then transitioned to Tableau to create an interactive dashboard.
